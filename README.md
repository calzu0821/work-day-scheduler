## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is an intuitive calendar application that enables users to schedule events for each hour of the day. This browser-based application features dynamic HTML and CSS updates using jQuery, and leverages the Day.js library to manage date and time.

The primary goal of the Work Day Scheduler is to provide a practical and user-friendly tool for busy employees to manage their schedules effectively. By offering a simple interface to schedule important events throughout the day, this application enables users to keep track of their tasks and allocate their time more efficiently.

The Work Day Scheduler resolves the challenge of scheduling tasks by providing users with a clear visualization of their day, along with the ability to quickly add and edit events. This enables users to stay on top of their schedule and optimize their workday.

By developing the Work Day Scheduler, I gained valuable experience in using jQuery to update HTML and CSS in real-time, as well as working with date and time using the Day.js library.
